                    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
                    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
                    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>

                    Software, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>
                
                    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>

                    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br>
                    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br>
                    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br>
                    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br>
                    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br><br>
                
                    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
                    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
                    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
                    presented to the users.<br><br>
                
                    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
                    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>
                    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br>

                    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>
                    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br>
                    remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br>
                    using the Font Software.<br><br>
                
                    TERMINATION<br>
                    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br>
                    not met.<br><br>
